# Element Heroes — The Periodic Wars

> *"Learn the elements. Master the reactions. Win the Periodic Wars."*

A pixel-art 2D top-down adventure game built in **Godot 4** around all 118 elements of the periodic table. Collect real elements, craft real chemical compounds, and battle element-themed enemies across six biomes — all grounded in actual chemistry.

**Target audience:** Grades 6–12 · **Engine:** Godot 4 (GDScript) · **Status:** Active development

## Features

### Exploration & World
- **Procedurally generated top-down world** — 200×200 tile map across 6 distinct biomes
- **6 element-themed biomes** — each with unique ore deposits, enemies, and a Compound Titan boss
- **Ashenveil village** — NPC hub with Prof. Aldric Voss, the Synthesizer machine, and the research lab

### Chemistry Crafting
- **All 118 elements** collectible with realistic lab equipment constraints (containers, PPE tiers)
- **65+ compound recipes** matching real chemical formulas in a 3×3 crafting grid
- **Synthesizer machine** — polymer lab for advanced plastic/composite intermediates
- **Real lab handling data** — every element requires the correct container tier and PPE

### Combat
- **Real-time Zelda-style combat** — melee arc attacks + ranged projectiles
- **10 weapons (Tiers 1–5)** — melee and ranged, with DoT effects (burn, irradiate, poison)
- **5 armors (Tiers 1–5)** — flat damage reduction, single equipment slot
- **I-frames, stun, knockback, armor corrode** — full status effect system

### Enemies & Bosses
- **18 CHIMERA creature types × 3 tiers** = 54 total variants, fully data-driven
- **6 Compound Titan bosses** — 3-phase fights with arena hazards and element drops
- **Special abilities** — explosions, auras, ranged attacks, phase transitions, drain effects

### Education — Phase 6
- **In-game Compendium** — 118-element periodic table, auto-unlocks on discovery
- **Science Mini-Game** — chemistry quiz at Aldric's desk, 26 questions across 6 topics
- Element rewards for correct answers · HP penalty + explanation for wrong ones
- S/A/B/C graded sessions with Prof. Aldric quotes

### Audio & Art (in progress)
- **AudioManager** autoload — crossfading biome music, 12-slot SFX pool, volume control
- Full **sprite animation spec** written (`assets/sprites/SPRITE_SPEC.md`)
- Folders and wiring ready — drop `.ogg` files and sprite sheets in to activate
